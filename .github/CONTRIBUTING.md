# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to this product! We welcome any contributions, whether it's bug fixes, new features, or improvements to the existing codebase.

### Your First Pull Request

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this free video series:

[How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

To help you get familiar with our contribution process, we have a list of [good first issues](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) that contain bugs that have a relatively limited scope. This is a great place to get started.

If you decide to fix an issue, please be sure to check the comment thread in case somebody is already working on a fix. If nobody is working on it at the moment, please leave a comment stating that you intend to work on it so other people donâ€™t accidentally duplicate your effort.

If somebody claims an issue but doesnâ€™t follow up for more than two weeks, itâ€™s fine to take it over but you should still leave a comment. **Issues won't be assigned to anyone outside the core team**.
