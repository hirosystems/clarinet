# The clarinet-sdk is published to npm when a release is created.
# It's based on the npm workspace defined in the package.json at the root of the project.
# Two packages are built with wasm-pack - @hirosystems/clarinet-sdk-wasm and @hirosystems/clarinet-sdk-wasm-browser
# They need to be built first
# Then two packages are built with tsc - @hirosystems/clarinet-sdk and @hirosystems/clarinet-sdk-browser
