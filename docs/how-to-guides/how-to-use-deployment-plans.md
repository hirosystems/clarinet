# Deployment plans

Deployment Plans are reproducible deployment steps that publish a collection of on-chain transactions and one or more contracts to a network, whether a local developer network, the public testnet, or into production on mainnet. Deployment plans minimize the inherent complexity of deployments, such as smart contract dependencies and interactions, transaction chaining limits, deployment costs, and more, while ensuring reproducible deployments critical for testing purposes.

Furthermore, many details of the blockchain environment you want to deploy to are configurable in a deployment plan's specifications.

| Network | Features | Limitations |
| ------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `simnet` | - Widely configurable Stacks simnet <br> - No private keys needed (for contacts, transactions) <br> - Stored entirely in memory | - No Bitcoin emulation |
| `devnet` | - Widely configurable Stacks and Bitcoin devnets <br> - Publish contracts, transactions across multiple Stacks and/or Bitcoin blocks <br> - Control chainstate for tests | - Accounts need private keys (see `devnet.toml`) |
| `testnet`/`mainnet` | - Public networks with other users and contracts <br> | - Time-consuming and expensive environment for testing |

## View your deployment plan

Clarinet uses a deployment plan for every deployment-whether for a basic simnet (for use in Clarinet's `console`, `test`, and `check` features), a devnet (for use with Clarinet's `integrate` command), or the public testnet and mainnet.

You can view the current deployment plan saved to disk at any time with the following command (specifying the network `simnet`, `devnet`, `testnet`, `mainnet`)

```bash
clarinet deployments generate --<network>
```

Upon this command, your project's deployment plan, a `.yaml` file (for example, `default.devnet-plan.yaml`), is generated by default from your project specifications and contracts. Here, for example, is the deployment plan for [this `counter` smart contract application](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet/blob/develop/components/clarinet-cli/examples/counter/deployments/default.devnet-plan.yaml):

```toml
---
id: 0
name: Devnet deployment
network: devnet
stacks-node: "http://localhost:20443"
bitcoin-node: "http://devnet:devnet@localhost:18443"
plan:
  batches:
    - id: 0
      transactions:
        - contract-publish:
            contract-name: counter
            expected-sender: ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM
            cost: 5960
            path: contracts/counter.clar
            anchor-block-only: true
            clarity-version: 1
```

## Specifications files 

A project's deployment plan specifications are set on two files within a Clarinet project—the `clarinet.toml` file as well as the network’s corresponding `.toml` file (for example, `devnet.toml`) in the `/settings` folder. 

Specifications in the `clarinet.toml` file you can change include
- The Clarity version or blockchain epoch that Clarinet emulates for your smart contracts
- Contract dependencies you would like to simulate

Specifications in the `devnet.toml` file you can change include
- Accounts, balances, and names
- Blockchain environment features, such as block time or API ports, of your devnet
- [Stacking](https://docs.stacks.co/docs/understand-stacks/stacking) orders

## Edit your deployment plan directly

Recall that a default deployment plan is used for every deployment, comprising your projects specifications as set in your `clarinet.toml` and `devnet.toml` files.

The plan is generated upon each `clarinet deployments generate --<network>` shell command to your `/deployments` folder.

However, you can also manually edit this default deployment `.yaml` file directly—programmatically orchestrating your contract publication and interaction beyond your plan's defaults—with these `transaction` types and their fields available: 

:::note
When deploying, Clarinet prompts you to overwrite any manually added or edited changes that differ from the specifications laid out in your project's `.toml` files. Type `no` to proceed with your manually configured deployment plan.
:::

Here are some of the relevant transactions and configurations available to developers manually configuring their deployment plans:
- `emulated-contract-publish`: Deploy a contract in an in-memory simulated chain (`simnet` only).
- `emulated-contract-call`: Call a contract that has been deployed in an in-memory simulated chain (simnet only).
- `requirement-publish`: Deploy an external contract (that is, one not published by the same set of private keys as the user wallet currently deploying) on another `testnet`/`devnet` using another wallet + search, and replace all the references to this contract in the local contracts to deploy (`devnet`/`testnet` only).
- `contract-publish`: Deploy a contract (`devnet`/`testnet`/`mainnet`).
- `contract-call`: Call a contract (`devnet`/`testnet`/`mainnet`).
- `stx-transfer`: Transfer STX between specified accounts.
- `btc-transfer`: Simple bitcoin transfer from a p2pkh address to a p2pkh address (experimental, `regtest`/`testnet`/`mainnet`).
- Waiting between blocks to make transactions is done by specifying transaction directives in a different batch in the deployment plan (see the `batches` field)



### `emulated-contract-publish`

This default transaction is included in every generated deployment for a `simnet` deployment. The institutional lending protocol [Zest has a code audit](https://github.com/Trust-Machines/Zest-Audit/blob/1c35ea49fff7d990aa58d045f1e3bcac5e65406c/deployments/default.simnet-plan.yaml) that includes a simnet environment

```toml
transactions:
    - emulated-contract-publish:
        contract-name: extension-trait
        emulated-sender: ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM
        path: contracts/dao/traits/extension-trait.clar
        clarity-version: 1
```

### `emulated-contract-call`

This is a transaction type for a `simnet` deployment where the developer wants to emulate a contract call.

```toml
- emulated-contract-call:
    contract-id: ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.counter
    emulated-sender: ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM
    method: increment
    parameters:
        - u1
```

### `requirement-publish`

This cBTC smart contract application has a [devnet deployment plan](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet/blob/develop/components/clarinet-cli/examples/cbtc/deployments/default.devnet-plan.yaml) that publishes the contract required by its core smart contract.

```toml
transactions:
    - requirement-publish:
        contract-id: SP3FBR2AGK5H9QBDH3EEN6DF8EK8JY7RX8QJ5SVTE.sip-010-trait-ft-standard
        remap-sender: ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM
        remap-principals:

```

### `contract-publish`

This default transaction is included in every generated deployment plan for every contract your Clarinet project has. This "counter" application has a [devnet deployment plan](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet/blob/develop/components/clarinet-cli/examples/counter/deployments/default.devnet-plan.yaml) that publishes its core smart contract.

```toml
transactions:
    - contract-publish:
        contract-name: counter
        expected-sender: ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM
        cost: 5960
        path: contracts/counter.clar
        anchor-block-only: true
        clarity-version: 1
```

### `contract-call`

The developer can call a function and pass arguments of any valid Clarity type.

```toml
transactions:
    - contract-call:
        contract-id: ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.bitcoin-dao
        expected-sender: ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM
        method: increment
        parameters:
            - u1
            - (some 0x00010203)
            - { id: u4, username: "Satashi", address: 'SP1HTBVD3JG9C05J7HBJTHGR0GGW7KXW28M5JS8QE }
        cost: 5960
```

### `stx-transfer`

The developer can specify the originating account of an STX transfer, the quantity denominated in microstacks, and the recipient, as well as an optional memo field (Note: the memo field can only contain a Clarity [buffer type](https://book.clarity-lang.org/ch02-02-sequence-types.html) up to 34 bytes in size, pre-fixed with `0x` (for example, `0x68656c6c6f21`), not ASCII text or strings)

```toml
transactions:
    - stx-transfer:
        expected-sender: ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM
        recipient: ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM.my-contract
        mstx-amount: 1000
        memo: "0x01"
        cost: 10000
```

### `btc-transfer`

This cBTC smart contract application has a [devnet deployment plan](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet/blob/develop/components/clarinet-cli/examples/cbtc/deployments/wrap-btc.devnet-plan.yaml) that includes broadcasting a BTC transfer transaction to the emulated bitcoin chain with these parameters.

```toml
transactions:
    - btc-transfer:
        expected-sender: mjSrB3wS4xab3kYqFktwBzfTdPg367ZJ2d
        recipient: bcrt1qnxknq3wqtphv7sfwy07m7e4sr6ut9yt6ed99jg
