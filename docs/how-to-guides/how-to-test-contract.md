title: Test Contract
---

Clarinet supports automatic testing, where your blockchain application requirements can be converted to test cases. Clarinet comes with a testing harness based on Deno that applies the unit tests you write in TypeScript to your smart contracts.

## Clarity contracts and unit tests

Let us consider a `counter` smart contract to get a basic understanding of how to write unit tests for our application requirements.

```clarity
;; counter
(define-data-var counter uint u1) ;; counter initialized to 1

(define-public (increment (step uint)) ;; increment counter, print new-val
    (let ((new-val (+ step (var-get counter)))) 
        (var-set counter new-val)
        (print { object: "counter", action: "incremented", value: new-val })
        (ok new-val)))

(define-public (decrement (step uint)) ;; decrement counter, print new-val
    (let ((new-val (- step (var-get counter)))) 
        (var-set counter new-val)
        (print { object: "counter", action: "decremented", value: new-val })
        (ok new-val)))

(define-read-only (read-counter) ;; read value of counter
    (ok (var-get counter)))
```

Our `counter` application keeps track of an initialized value, allows for incrementing and decrementing, and prints actions as a log. Let us turn these requirements into unit tests.

### Unit tests for `counter` example

When you created your Clarity contract with `$ clarinet contract new <my-project>`, Clarinet automatically created a test file for the contract within the tests directory:  `tests/my-projects_test.ts`. Other files under the `tests/` directory following the Deno test naming convention will also be included:

- named test.{ts, tsx, mts, js, mjs, jsx, cjs, cts},
- or ending with .test.{ts, tsx, mts, js, mjs, jsx, cjs, cts},
- or ending with \_test.{ts, tsx, mts, js, mjs, jsx, cjs, cts}

Within these tests, developers can simulate mining a block containing transactions using their contract, and then examine the results of those transactions as well as the events generated by them.

>  **_NOTE:_**
>
> If you see an error in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) on the imports in the generated test file(s), that says, "An import path cannot end with a '.ts' extension" (example below), installing the [Deno extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno) will resolve this error.

![VS Code deno error](../images/deno-error.png)

To define a Clarinet test you need to register it with a call to `Clarinet.test()`. In the example unit test below, you see us
1. Importing the relevant classes from the Clarinet module on Deno
2. Instantiating and passing common Clarinet objects to our `Clarinet.test()` API call
3. Defining a user `wallet_1`, calling `increment`, and asserting its results

```TypeScript
// counter_test.ts - A unit test file
import { Clarinet, Tx, Chain, Account, types } from 'https://deno.land/x/clarinet@v1.0.5/index.ts';

Clarinet.test({
    name: "Ensure that increment works.",
    async fn(chain: Chain, accounts: Map<string, Account>) {
        let wallet_1 = accounts.get("wallet_1")!; // instantiate a user

        let block = chain.mineBlock([
            Tx.contractCall("counter", "increment", [types.uint(3)], wallet_1.address) // increment counter by 3
        ]);

        block.receipts[0].result // ensure that counter returned 3
            .expectOk()
            .expectUint(3)
    },
});
```

We run this test with
```zsh
$ clarinet test
```

For a complete list of classes, objects, and interfaces available, see the [Deno's Clarinet module index](https://deno.land/x/clarinet/index.ts).

### Comprehensive unit tests for `counter`

Let us now write a higher coverage test suite.


```TypeScript
// counter_test.ts - a comprehensive unit test file
import { Clarinet, Tx, Chain, Account, Contract, types } from 'https://deno.land/x/clarinet@v1.0.2/index.ts';
import { assertEquals } from "https://deno.land/std@0.90.0/testing/asserts.ts";

Clarinet.test({
    name: "Ensure that counter can be incremented multiples per block, accross multiple blocks",
    async fn(chain: Chain, accounts: Map<string, Account>, contracts: Map<string, Contract>) {
        let wallet_1 = accounts.get("wallet_1")!;
        let wallet_2 = accounts.get("wallet_2")!; // multiple users

        let block = chain.mineBlock([
            Tx.contractCall("counter", "increment", [types.uint(1)], wallet_1.address),
            Tx.contractCall("counter", "increment", [types.uint(4)], wallet_1.address),
            Tx.contractCall("counter", "increment", [types.uint(10)], wallet_1.address)
        ]); // multiple contract calls

        assertEquals(block.height, 2); // asserting block height
        block.receipts[0].result // checking log for expected results
            .expectOk()
            .expectUint(2);
        block.receipts[1].result
            .expectOk()
            .expectUint(6);
        block.receipts[2].result
            .expectOk()
            .expectUint(16);

        block = chain.mineBlock([
            Tx.contractCall("counter", "increment", [types.uint(1)], wallet_1.address),
            Tx.contractCall("counter", "increment", [types.uint(4)], wallet_1.address),
            Tx.contractCall("counter", "increment", [types.uint(10)], wallet_1.address),
            Tx.transferSTX(1, wallet_2.address, wallet_1.address),
        ]); // more contract calls, and an STX transfer

        assertEquals(block.height, 3);
        block.receipts[0].result
            .expectOk()
            .expectUint(17);
        block.receipts[1].result
            .expectOk()
            .expectUint(21);
        block.receipts[2].result
            .expectOk()
            .expectUint(31); 

        let result = chain.getAssetsMaps(); // asserting account balances
        assertEquals(result.assets["STX"][wallet_1.address], 99999999999999);

        let call = chain.callReadOnlyFn("counter", "read-counter", [], wallet_1.address)
        call.result
            .expectOk()
            .expectUint(31); // asserting a final counter value

        "0x0001020304".expectBuff(new Uint8Array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])); // asserting buffers
        "ST1HTBVD3JG9C05J7HBJTHGR0GGW7KXW28M5JS8QE.plaid-token".expectPrincipal('ST1HTBVD3JG9C05J7HBJTHGR0GGW7KXW28M5JS8QE.plaid-token'); // asserting principals
    },
});
```

Here, variously, we:
- instantiated multiple accounts
- called functions across multiple blocks
- asserted block heights between transactions
- tested transfers and balances

## Measure and increase code coverage

To help developers maximizing their test coverage, Clarinet can produce a `lcov` report, using the following option:

```bash
$ clarinet test --coverage
```

From there, you can use the `lcov` tooling suite to produce HTML reports.

```bash
$ brew install lcov
$ genhtml coverage.lcov
$ open index.html
```

![lcov](../images/lcov.png)

## Cost optimization

Clarinet can also be used for optimizing costs. When you execute a test suite, Clarinet keeps track of all costs being computed when executing the `contract-call`, and display the most expensive ones in a table:

```bash
$ clarinet test --cost
```

The `--cost` option can be used in conjunction with `--watch` and filters to maximize productivity, as illustrated here:

![costs](../images//costs.gif)

## Load contracts in a console

The Clarinet console is an interactive Clarity Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop (REPL) console that runs in-memory. Any contracts in the current project are
automatically loaded into memory.

```bash
$ clarinet console
```

You can use the `::help` command in the console for a list of valid commands, which can control the state of the REPL chain, and let you advance the chain tip. Additionally, you may enter Clarity commands into the console and observe
the result of the command.

You may exit the console by pressing `Ctrl + C` twice.

Changes to contracts are not loaded into the console while it is running. If you make any changes to your contracts you must exit the console and run it again.

## Spawn a local Devnet

You can use Clarinet to deploy your contracts to your own local offline environment for testing and evaluation on a blockchain.

Use the following command:

```bash
$ clarinet integrate
```

Make sure that you have a working installation of Docker running locally.

## Interacting with contracts deployed on Mainnet

Composition and interactions between protocols and contracts are one of the key innovations in blockchains. 
Clarinet was designed to handle these types of interactions.

Before referring to contracts deployed on Mainnet, they should be explicitily be listed as a `requirement` in the manifest `Clarinet.toml`, either manually:

```toml
[project]
name = "my-project"
[[project.requirements]]
contract_id = "SP2KAF9RF86PVX3NEE27DFV1CQX0T4WGR41X3S45C.bitcoin-whales"
```

or with the command:

```bash
clarinet requirements add SP2KAF9RF86PVX3NEE27DFV1CQX0T4WGR41X3S45C.bitcoin-whales
```

From there, Clarinet will be able to resolve the `contract-call?` statements invoking requirements present in your local contracts by downloading and caching a copy of these contracts and using them during the execution of your test suites, in addition to all the different features available in `clarinet`.

When deploying your protocol to Devnet / Testnet, for the contracts involving requirements, the setting `remap_requirements` in your deployment plans must be set.

As a step-by-step example, we use here the following contract, [**bitcoin-whales**](https://explorer.stacks.co/txid/SP2KAF9RF86PVX3NEE27DFV1CQX0T4WGR41X3S45C.bitcoin-whales?chain=mainnet)

If you examine this contract, you will see that there are 3 different dependencies: two from the **same** project (included in the same `Clarinet.toml` file), and one referring to a contract deployed outside of the current project.

## Same Project

In the contract snippet below *(line:260-265)*, there are dependencies on the contracts conversion and conversion-v2 which are included in the same `Clarinet.toml` file.

```clarity
(define-read-only (get-token-uri (token-id uint))
  (if (< token-id u5001)
    (ok (some (concat (concat (var-get ipfs-root) (unwrap-panic (contract-call? .conversion lookup token-id))) ".json")))
    (ok (some (concat (concat (var-get ipfs-root) (unwrap-panic (contract-call? .conversion-v2 lookup (- token-id u5001)))) ".json")))
    )
)
```

## External Deployer 

In this snippet, there is a dependency on the `nft-trait` *(line:001)* deployed by `'SP2PABAF9FTAJYNFZH93XENAJ8FVY99RRM50D2JG9`.

```clarity
(impl-trait 'SP2PABAF9FTAJYNFZH93XENAJ8FVY99RRM50D2JG9.nft-trait.nft-trait)
```

Dependencies from **external** contracts should be set in `[[project.requirements]]`.

Dependencies from **internal** contracts no longer need to be set in `depends_on`, however, this is still present in many contracts, tutorials and documentations. 

```toml
[project]
name = "my-project"
[[project.requirements]]
contract_id = "SP2PABAF9FTAJYNFZH93XENAJ8FVY99RRM50D2JG9.nft-trait"
boot_contracts = ["pox", "costs-v2", "bns"]
[project.cache_location]
path = ".requirements"
[contracts.bitcoin-whales]
path = "contracts/bitcoin-whales.clar"
# depends_on = ["conversion","conversion-v2"] # no longer needed, ignored if provided
[contracts.conversion]
path = "contracts/conversion.clar"
[contracts.conversion-v2]
path = "contracts/conversion-v2.clar"
[repl]
costs_version = 2
parser_version = 2
[repl.analysis]
passes = ["check_checker"]
[repl.analysis.check_checker]
strict = false
trusted_sender = false
trusted_caller = false
callee_filter = false
```

As a next step, we may generate a deployment plan for this project.

If running `$ clarinet integrate` for the first time, this file should be created by Clarinet.

In addition, you may run `$ clarinet deployment generate --devnet` to create or overwrite.

```yaml
---
id: 0
name: Devnet deployment
network: devnet
stacks-node: "http://localhost:20443"
bitcoin-node: "http://devnet:devnet@localhost:18443"
plan:
  batches:
    - id: 0
      transactions:
        - requirement-publish:
            contract-id: SP2PABAF9FTAJYNFZH93XENAJ8FVY99RRM50D2JG9.nft-trait
            remap-sender: ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM
            remap-principals:
              SP2PABAF9FTAJYNFZH93XENAJ8FVY99RRM50D2JG9: ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM
            cost: 4680
            path: ".requirements\\SP2PABAF9FTAJYNFZH93XENAJ8FVY99RRM50D2JG9.nft-trait.clar"
        - contract-publish:
            contract-name: conversion
            expected-sender: ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM
            cost: 340250
            path: "contracts\\conversion.clar"
            anchor-block-only: true
        - contract-publish:
            contract-name: conversion-v2
            expected-sender: ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM
            cost: 351290
            path: "contracts\\conversion-v2.clar"
            anchor-block-only: true
        - contract-publish:
            contract-name: bitcoin-whales
            expected-sender: ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM
            cost: 87210
            path: "contracts\\bitcoin-whales.clar"
            anchor-block-only: true
```

As you can see from the example above, Clarinet will remap the external contract to our Devnet address. In addition, Clarinet will also create a copy of it in the folder `requirements`

## Use Clarinet in your CI workflow as a GitHub Action

Clarinet may be used in GitHub Actions as a step of your CI workflows.
You may set-up a simple workflow by adding the following steps in a file `.github/workflows/github-actions-clarinet.yml`:

```yaml
name: CI
on: [push]
jobs:
  tests:
    name: "Test contracts with Clarinet"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: "Execute unit tests"
        uses: docker://hirosystems/clarinet:latest
        with:
          args: test --coverage --manifest-path=./Clarinet.toml
      - name: "Export code coverage"
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v1
        with:
          files: ./coverage.lcov
          verbose: true
```

Or add the steps above in your existing workflows. The generated code coverage output can then be 
used as is with GitHub Apps like https://codecov.io.
