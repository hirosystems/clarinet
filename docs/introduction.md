# Clarinet Overview

## What is Clarinet?

[Clarinet](https://www.hiro.so/clarinet) provides a CLI package with a [clarity](https://clarity-lang.org/) runtime, a REPL, and a testing harness. Clarinet includes a Javascript library, a testing environment, and a browser-based Sandbox. With Clarinet, you can rigorously iterate on your smart contracts locally before moving into production.

Clarinet consists of two components:

- Clarity REPL (Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop)
- Testing harness.

When the above components are used together, you can rapidly develop and test a Clarity smart contract, by deploying the contract to a local `devnet` or `testnet` environment.

To better understand Clarinet and how to develop with Clarinet, Hiro has created an introductory video tutorial series from Hiro Engineer [Ludo Galabru](https://twitter.com/ludovic?lang=en) that will guide you through some of the basics of using Clarinet. The video series also shows you how to use Clarinet to develop, test, and deploy smart contracts.

To view these video tutorials, please see [Hiro's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5Ujm489LoJaAz9kUJm8lYUWdGJ2AnQTb).

When developing smart contracts, you can also use the [Clarity Visual Studio Code plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HiroSystems.clarity-lsp).
