## What is Clarinet?

[Clarinet](https://www.hiro.so/clarinet) provides a CLI package with a [clarity](https://clarity-lang.org/) runtime, an REPL, and a testing harness. Clarinet includes a Javascript library, testing environment, and a browser-based Sandbox. With Clarinet, you can rigorously iterate on your smart contracts locally before moving into production.

Clarinet consists of two components:

- Clarity REPL (Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop)
- Testing harness.

When the above components are used together, you can rapidly develop and test a Clarity smart contract, with the need to deploy the contract to a local devnet or testnet environments.

To better understand Clarinet and how to develop with Clarinet, Hiro has created an introductory video tutorial series, from Hiro Engineer [Ludo Galabru](https://twitter.com/ludovic?lang=en), that will guide you through some of the basics and fundamentals of using Clarinet. The video also includes how you can use Clarinet to develop, test, and deploy smart contracts.
