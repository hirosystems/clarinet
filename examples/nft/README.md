# NFT

The example project in this directory is a simple NFT contract. This contract conforms to the traits outlined by
[SIP-009](https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-009/sip-009-nft-standard.md), and contains a contract
that defines those traits (`contracts/nft-trait.clar`).

A full write-up of this example can be found in the [Stacks documentation](https://docs.stacks.co/write-smart-contracts/nft).
