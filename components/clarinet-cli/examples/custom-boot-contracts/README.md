# Custom Boot Contracts Example

This example demonstrates how to use override boot contracts in simnet (`clarinet console` or unit tests with the sdk)

## Overview

Clarinet embeds a copy of the boot contracts (like `pox-4`, `costs`, etc.) that are used by default. For Stacks core developers, it's useful to be able to load custom code instead of the embedded versions. **Note: Only existing boot contracts can be overridden - new boot contracts cannot be added.**

## Configuration

To override boot contracts, add an `[override_boot_contracts_source]` section to your `Clarinet.toml`:

```toml
[project]
name = "my-project"
# ... other project settings

[project.override_boot_contracts_source]
pox-4 = "./custom-boot-contracts/pox-5.clar"
```

## Supported Boot Contract Overrides

You can override any of the following boot contracts:
- `genesis`
- `lockup`
- `bns`
- `cost-voting`
- `costs`
- `pox`
- `costs-2`
- `pox-2`
- `costs-3`
- `pox-3`
- `pox-4`
- `signers`
- `signers-voting`

## How It Works

1. When Clarinet loads boot contracts, it first checks if there are any overrides specified in the `Clarinet.toml`
2. If an override is found for a specific boot contract, it loads the custom source from the specified file path
3. **Only existing boot contracts can be overridden** - if a non-standard boot contract name is specified, a warning is printed and it is skipped
4. The custom source is used instead of the embedded version
5. If the custom file cannot be loaded, a warning is printed and the embedded version is used as fallback

## Example Usage

In this example:

- **Custom PoX-4 Contract** (`custom-boot-contracts/pox-4.clar`): Overrides the default PoX-4 contract with custom logic
- **Note**: The `pox-5` contract in the example configuration will be skipped with a warning since it's not a standard boot contract

## Testing

To test this example:

```bash
cd components/clarinet-cli/examples/custom-boot-contracts
clarinet console
```

In the console, you can test the custom boot contracts:

```clarity
;; Test the custom pox-5 contract
(contract-call? 'SP000000000000000000002Q6VF78.pox-4 get-pox-info)
```

## Use Cases

This feature is particularly useful for:
- Stacks core developers testing changes to boot contracts
- Research and experimentation with different boot contract implementations
- Custom blockchain configurations for development and testing
- Educational purposes to understand how boot contracts work
