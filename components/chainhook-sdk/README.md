# Clarinet Chainhook

This project is also referred to as "Chainhook V1".

It's a tools that allow to listen for events on the Stacks and Bitcoin blockchains, and trigger
webhooks in response to those events, based on predicates.  
Clarinet relies on Chainhook in the Devnet to orchestrate it and display the relevant information.

Hiro's Chainhook V2 replaces this V1. We still keep it in Clarinet for usage in the Devnet.

Although, it's possible that a lot of the code is unused, since the scope of Chainhook V1 in the
context of the Devnet is much smaller than the original Chainhook project.
